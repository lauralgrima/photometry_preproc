    "This notebook contains allows exploration of different preprocessing options for photometry data. There are various different ways to preprocess this kind of data, so the idea behind this notebook is to act as an easy-to-use resource for trying various approaches out and visualising the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of this notebook are heavily inspired by Thomas Akam's code [here](https://github.com/ThomasAkam/photometry_preprocessing/blob/master/Photometry%20data%20preprocessing.ipynb) as well as discussions with Marta Blanco Pozo and Luke Coddington. However, if you come across any errors or have any questions please message me at grimal@janelia.hhmi.org.\n",

    "The data used in this notebook were recorded from the NACc core of a mouse during a freely moving reward-based task. [pyPhotometry](https://pyphotometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) acquisition hardware and software was used in two colour time division mode, with GCaMP8m as the calcium indicator and tdTomato as movement control. \n",
